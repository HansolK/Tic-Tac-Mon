# How does it work?
In this game, you are able to put your names in the first page and choose their characters. It is a simple tic-tac-toe game but with the cute pokemon characters!

# Approach
In this game, I tried to make a simple table as a outline and provided combinations of win. Each time users click one of the cells, the computer keeps on track of the location where it is clicked. The computer then loops through the matching combination depends on what you click, and then it will tell the winner on the screen.
